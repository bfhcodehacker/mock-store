## Description

This is a simple store app using react-native with typescript and react-navigation

The app uses data from dummyjson - 
https://dummyjson.com/

It is implementing redux toolkit with thunk for fetching and storing data - 
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/

and eventually RTK Query for product fetching - 
https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview

I am also planning on implementing a barcode scanner and geolocator
